# Matomo Analytics for Bludit

**This is still Beta** I'm working to fix the issues.

Matomo Analytics plugin for Bludit.

Adds a Matomo tracking code to the site's `<head>`. Basic tracking support, you need to provide the Piwik server URL and the Site ID. This last information can be found in the Piwik's generated tracking code.

Forked from lgg42/piwikanalytics which did not receive any updates since 2017 and does not support Bludit 3.x
