# Matomo Analytics for Bludit


Matomo Analytics plugin for Bludit.

Adds a Matomo tracking code to the site's `<head>`. Basic tracking support, you need to provide the Matomo server URL and the Site ID. This last information can be found in Matomo's generated tracking code.

Forked from [lgg42](https://github.com/lgg42/piwikanalytics) which did not receive any updates since 2017 and does not support Bludit 3.x.
